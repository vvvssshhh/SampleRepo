for data science JAVA Tools
Weka(data mining)
Java-ML (ml library)
Apacha MLlib (scalable ml)
deepliearning4j

Apache Hadoop (java build application manages data processing and storage running in clusters(HD)
Scala language
(for data science APache spark -prvides APIs making parallel jobs easy to write - designesd to run faster than Hadoop)
deep learning application -tensor flow, apache spark, pytorch, caffe
Julia is computaional and statatica ml language for data science


OPen source softwares and Tools
Data science work flow and its software
Data Management - MySQL,PostgreSQL,NOSQL(MongoDB,,Apache CouchDB, Apache Cassandra),Filebadestools(Hadoop HDFS,CEPH)
Data Integration and Transformation -work ELT (extract,load,transform) (data refining and cleaning) -Apache airflow (AIRBNB), kube flow, APache kafka (linkedin), 				    	     APache nifi(nice visual editor), Apache sparks SQL (uses ansi SQL and uses 1000 computers), node-red (need little resource like 				    	     work on raspberry pi)
Data Visualization - HUE (create visualization from SQL Querry), kibana (limited to elastic search( text or doc search)), Apache superset (data exploration and 		    		     visualization web application)
Model Deployment - coverting ML model into API for others - Apache prediction IO(works on APache Spark), seldon(supports Apache sparkml, tensor flow, R, scikit-		   	    learn), mleap, tensor flow service, tensorflow.lite (for raspberry, smartphone), tensorflow.js (deploy to browser)
Model Monitoring and Assesment - modelDB (Apache spark, scikiit-learns), prometheus, AI firness 360 source tool kit (for bias adjustment), IBM adversialrobustness 360 				 (to detect vulnerable to bad data), IBM AI Explainability 360 (make ml process more understandable , since ml is magic box)
Code asset management - version management & version control - git (github, gitlab, bit bucket)
Data asset management - data governance and data lineage (data origin, what happens to it and where it moves over time) - Apache Atalas, ODBI EGERIA, Kylo


Development environment, data integration, transfomation, visualization
Development environment - Jupyter (designed for python, support other languages through kernels), jupyter labs (advanced jupyter notebook), apache zeppelin, spyder, R 			  studio
Execution environment - if data dosent fit in single memory - APacche spark (cluster computing, batch data processing), APache Flink (lly to APache spark but focus on 			processing real time data processing), Riselab-RAY
Fully integrated Visual Tools - no programming language is necessary - KNIME, ORANGE (does Data Integration and Transformation ,Data Visualization ,Model Deployment)				(extend by programming in R, Python, APache Spark)
